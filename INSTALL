I'm not sure of the official way to install python programs in linux.
currently I install my own programs in /opt.  Here is how you can do the 
same

None of this is needed to actually run the program, you could just 
untar it, open the new folder in a file browser and doubleclick on 
timplayer.py, but that gets annoying after a while.

1. Unzip this archive if you haven't already using:
    tar -xzvf calix-0.1.0.tar.gz

2. Move the folder to /opt (This requires superuser privileges on most 
systems)
    sudo mv calix /opt/

3. If you installed it somewhere else you will need to update the 
timplayer script to point to your new location.

4. If you want system wide access from the command prompt:
    cd /usr/bin  (or any folder in your path (maybe ~/.bin)
    ln -s /opt/calix/calix

5. Now you can run it from any command prompt as calix

6. Add a .desktop file to your desktop or panel.  I put one on my top 
panel in Gnome using the "Create cuatom launcher..." command using the 
following:

    Name: Calix
    Command: '/opt/calix/calix' or 'calix' if in path
    Icon: /opt/calix/pixmaps/icon.png

7. Click on your new launcher and get calibrating the fun way.

NOTE:
 This is a python program and I recommend/require the following be 
installed:

    python 2.4 (I'm haven't tested it on older versions)
    pygtk (a python module for the gui)
    x server (needs to have xgamma utility)
